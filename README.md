Terminal-Furby
==============

ASCII based Linux terminal game involving furbies

Idea of the game: protect the Furby from radioactive waste using shield. Waste comes in from all sides towards the Furby, use RIGHT/LEFT or UP/DOWN to rotate the shield and destroy the waste when it collides.

Game runs using Python3 and curses library. Currently it is just a sketch as it uses some utf-8 characters and has only been tested on Ubuntu with 1366x768 resolution. Since it is my first attempt to create a game, the mathemathical calculations and ncurses redrawing takes shitload of your RAM/CPU
